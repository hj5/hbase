		# yum install glog-devel

	4. To install Poco library
		# yum install poco-devel

	5. To install protobuf

	6. To install cyrus-sasl
		# yum install openssl
		# yum install cyrus-sasl-devel

	7. To install Kerberos libraries
		# yum install krb5-libs 

	8. To install zookeeper
		Following are the rpm for zookeeper-lib and zookeeper-lib-devel, which installs development package for zookeeper
		# wget http://mirror.openio.io/pub/repo/stable/openio/sds/centos/7/common/x86_64/zookeeperlib-3.4.6-2.el7.oio.x86_64.rpm
		# rpm –ivh zookeeper-lib-3.4.6-2.el7.oio.x86_64.rpm
		# wget http://mirror.openio.io/pub/repo/stable/openio/sds/centos/7/common/x86_64/zookeeper-lib-devel-3.4.6-2.el7.oio.x86_64.rpm
		# rpm –ivh zookeeper-lib-devel-3.4.6-2.el7.oio.x86_64.rpm	

	9. To build the driver, do the following
		a. cd <hbase_root_folder>/hbase_native_client/src
		b. make all
		c. [sudo] make install
			Both the debug and release binaries are built
	10. To run the tests, do the following
		a. cd <hbase_root_folder>/hbase_native_client/src/test
		b. chmod +x BuildTestClient.sh
		c. ./BuildTestClient.sh
		d. The above command produces a TestClient executable, both the debug and release ones.
		e. To run the TestClient, do a './TestClient <path_of_the_hbase_site.xml>' or
	 	'./TestClient_d <path_of_the_hbase_site.xml>'. '_d' means debug build.
